# Measuring distance

The [Ping Ultrasonic Range Finder exercise](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/sensors/Ping) for measuring distance using Arduino Nano, an ultrasonic sensor, and [EasyUltrasonic](https://github.com/SpulberGeorge/EasyUltrasonic/tree/main).

The serial monitor prints out the distance from the board to the nearest surface and prints out a message if it detects a block.
